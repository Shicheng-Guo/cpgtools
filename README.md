## CpGtools -- Tools to analyze and visualize DNA methylation data
---
## Installation

### Prerequisites
CpGtools are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). In particular,  **Python3 (v3.5.x)**
is required to run all scripts in CpGtools. Some scripts also need **R** to generate graphs and 
run generalized linear model (GLM).  

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

### Python Dependencies
Note: these packages will be automatically downloaded installed when you use [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
to install CpGtools.

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [pysam](https://pypi.org/project/pysam/)
- [bx-python](https://pypi.org/project/bx-python/)
- [pyBigWig](https://pypi.org/project/pyBigWig/)
- [sklearn](https://www.scilearn.com/)
- [weblogo](https://pypi.org/project/weblogo/)

### Install [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (Skip this step if you already have [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/))

1. First, download **[get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)**
		curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
2. Then run the following:
		python get-pip.py
3. Run the following code to check:
		pip3 --version
		pip 18.1 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)
		
		which pip3
		/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/pip
		
		which pip	
		/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/pip
Note that **pip** is actualy a soft link to the same executable file path with **pip3**. so you can use pip directly.
